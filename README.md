Gamma and Beta Band Oscillation in Working Memory given Sequential or Concurrent Multiple Items: A Spiking Network Model

```single trail``` runs simulation with one cue presented at 500ms and records the firing activities of PYR, FS, and NFS. 

You can change ```n_stimuli``` and ```sequential_delay``` to present different numbers of concurrent and sequential cues. In concurrent-cue tasks, an array of cues is presented to the network from 500ms to 700ms, followed by a delay period of 1300 ms (upper panel). In sequential-cue tasks, cues were presented one after another with an interval of 100ms, and each cue lasted for 200 ms.
